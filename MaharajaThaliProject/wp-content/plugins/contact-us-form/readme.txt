Contact Us form generates a custom contact form on your website sidebar, page, or post. 

== Description ==

<p>Contact Us Form is a simple Wordpress plugin that generates a contact form on your website or blog. It can also be used as a suggestion box. After adjusting the preferences (such as where do you want the email to go) simply insert [CONTACT-US-FORM] in any page or post content and the form will appear. You can also insert the form in the sidebar using the same shortcode. </p>
<p>If you are looking to implement a contact form in the sidebar, please use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sidebar-form/" title="Wordpress sidebar form">Sidebar From Plugin</a> instead. </p>
<p>The plugin is designed to use your website's CSS so the design is likely to match your website and if not there is a special area in the settings where you can customize the use of CSS. </p>
<p>We will continue working on the plugin as we get feedback from you. Learn more about Kenmore Design here: <a href="https://www.kenmoredesign.com/" alt="Boston Web Design" title="Web Design Company">www.kenmoredesign.com </a></p>
